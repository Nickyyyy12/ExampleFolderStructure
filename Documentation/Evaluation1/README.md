Objective and Validation Metrics

My goal:

Verify whether the user can understand the differences between the two roles.

Host: Uses Quest in Mixed Reality (MR) mode to see a real home environment overlaid with virtual objects

Guests: Enter the meeting space in VR mode using the scanned virtual room model

Test whether communication in this environment is natural and smooth.

Observe whether users think the meeting space lacks necessary functions.

Collect feedback from users regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the concept.

Interview Questions

Do you think the role you played (host/guest) is easy to understand?

Do you feel comfortable communicating with others in this space?

What functions do you think are lacking in this meeting space?

What do you think is the greatest advantage of this concept?

What do you hope I focus on improving in the next version?

Results

A total of 5 students were interviewed. The following feedback was obtained:

Category	Findings
Role understanding	Most participants indicated that the character settings were clear and they could distinguish whether they were the host or the guest.
Communication experience	Two students mentioned that the perspective difference might affect communication naturalness. It didn’t feel smooth.
Function deficiency	Most students said the prototype lacks essential functions such as a shared whiteboard, projection, or room information.
Concept advantages	Participants felt the concept was novel and interesting, with no existing similar experience.
Improvement direction	Suggestions focused on adding interactive virtual items to enhance engagement and participation.
Quotes

"I can tell whether I'm the host or the guest, but it feels like one is in reality and the other is in a virtual world. I find it a bit strange."
— Jialiang He, DECO2300 Thu 12:00, STU1

"I feel there are still not enough options. It would be great if you could add some other items that can stimulate my interest in the future. For example, pencils or whiteboards."
— Sean, DECO2300 Thu 12:00, STU1

"Your idea is very interesting. I haven't seen anything like it before. I'm looking forward to seeing your final product."
— Sijian Xin, DECO2300 Thu 12:00, STU1

Analysis

From the interview results:

Participants were able to understand and distinguish roles (host in MR vs guest in VR).

However, differences in perspectives caused unnatural communication, contradicting my original goal.

Many users requested more interactive tools, not just immersion.

Novelty of the idea is confirmed—users find it engaging and worth continuing.

Concept Iteration

Based on the analysis, I will iterate in the following directions:

✅ Enhance sharing and collaboration functions

Add virtual whiteboard

Add projection screen

Add shared desktop

✅ Add virtual interactive items

Introduce virtual tables, documents, buttons

Allow users to operate, not just observe

✅ Enrich VR room detail

Improve room model quality

Reduce sense of disconnection between MR and VR spaces

Reflection

Users quickly understood their roles → core idea is clear.

However, communication feels unnatural due to different realities (MR vs VR).

Lack of functionality is the most common feedback—users want collaboration tools.

Evaluation involved 5 participants using Think-Aloud method.

Prototype wasn’t tested on real Quest hardware → user experience accuracy might be affected.

Future plans:

Improve fidelity

Test with real Quest device

Add sharing tools + interactive functions
