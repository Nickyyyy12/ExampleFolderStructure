## Application Selection  

**Type:** Meeting & Scheduling  
**Application Name:** Zoom  

**Description:**  
Zoom is a popular meeting and scheduling platform that offers real-time video conferencing, screen sharing, and collaboration tools. It allows individuals and teams to connect and collaborate seamlessly, regardless of location. However, the conventional two-dimensional interface restricts spatial awareness, non-verbal communication, and engagement.  

In the XR environment, Zoom could be reimagined as an immersive, spatially aware meeting platform. The redesigned version will utilize 3D environments, gesture-based controls, and spatial audio to foster a more intuitive and engaging collaborative experience.

## User Tasks and Goals  

- **Task 1:** Create and Schedule Meetings  
  **Goal:** Quickly initiate or join a meeting.  

- **Task 2:** Sharing and collaboration content  
  **Goal:** Present and collaborate so that all meeting participants can see clearly and interact in real time.  

- **Task 3:** Group discussion and exchange  
  **Goal:** Have deeper discussions with group members or work on shared tasks.

## Concept Development & Iteration Process  

This concept was developed through an iterative process and has a very clear version.  
The initial idea was to transform Zoom into an XR environment with an open structure.  

- **Week 1:** Focused on identifying key user tasks and objectives, such as joining and starting a meeting.  
- **Week 2:** Created low-fidelity prototypes, including sketches of:
  - Virtual lobby  
  - Virtual meeting rooms  
  - Breakout rooms  

Prototypes were iterated and improved through feedback and self-reflection, such as:  
- Optimizing the visual effects of certain buttons  
- Adding interactive personal screens for each participant  
- Future ideas like spatial audio

## XR Concept Description  

### Lobby Interaction *(Before entering the meeting room)*  
**Environment:**  
Lounge chairs, plants, and information screens in the center of the lobby. Users spawn here by default.  

**Core interaction:**  
- **Approach the information screen:** Displays “Join Meeting” and “Create Meeting” buttons dynamically.  
- **Gesture click:** Reach out and click to proceed:  
  - Join Meeting → Fill in meeting information  
  - Create Meeting → Fill in meeting information

### XR Conference Room Scene *(During the meeting)*  
**Environment:**  
From the lobby, users move to the meeting room, where a circular or rectangular holographic conference table is at the center. The table surface displays and interacts with content. Backgrounds can switch between office or natural landscapes for immersion.  

**Documents and Collaboration:**  
- Annotate documents and share annotations when necessary  
- Place 3D models, PPTs, etc., in the center of the table  

**Immersive Details:**  
- Subtle ambient sounds in the background  
- Free seat selection before the meeting

### Breakout Room *(As the meeting drew to a close)*  
**Environment & Interaction:**  
- Choose and enter group discussion rooms in virtual space  
- Entrance displays group name and topic  
- Hear inside conversation before entering for presence effect  
- Inside: small conference table, personal screens with group task materials (zoom, annotate, share)  
- Spatial audio isolates voices between rooms for clear communication

## Initial Testing Plan  

**Interactions & Features to Test:**  
- Lobby gestures to join/create meetings  
- Personal screen zoom and annotation  

**Assumptions:**  
- Users intuitively understand the lobby entrance  
- First-person personal screens improve focus  
- Simple feedback is sufficient for confirmation  

**Validation Needs & Data Collection:**  
- Interviews for improvement suggestions  
- Measure task time, accidental touches, error rate  

**Method:**  
- Think-Aloud protocol  
- 4–6 participants  
- Low-fidelity sketches + paper buttons
